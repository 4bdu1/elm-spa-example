ðŸ‘‰ I gave [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1FU3e0sT1I),
to explain the principles I used to build this. I highly recommend watching it!

> [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://elm-spa-example.netlify.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

# Building

I decided not to include a build sccript, since all you need for local development is the `elm` executable, and all you need on top of that for production is Uglify.

## Development Build

Here's how to do a development build:

```
$ elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js
```

If you want to include the time-traveling debugger, add `--debug` like so:

```
$ elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js --debug
```

## Production Build

This is a two-step process. First we compile `elm.js` using `elm make` with `--optimize`, and then we run Uglify on the result.

#### Step 1

```
$ elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js --optimize
```

This generates production-optimized JS that is ready to be minified further using Uglify.

#### Step 2

(Make sure you have [Uglify](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/) installed first, e.g. with `npm install --global uglify-js`)

```
$ uglifyjs elm.js --compress 'pure_funcs="F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,A7,A8,A9",pure_getters=true,keep_fargs=false,unsafe_comps=true,unsafe=true' --output=elm.js && uglifyjs elm.js --mangle --output=elm.js
```

This runs `uglifyjs` twice - first with `--compress` and then again with `--mangle`. It's necessay to do separate passes if you use `pure_funcs` with Uglify, because if you do both `--compress` and `--mangle` at the same time, the `pure_funcs` argument will have no effect (Uglify will mangle the names first and then not recognize them when it encounters those functions later).
